# semantic-reboot
A combination of reset/normalize/reboot styles taken from multiple sources and frameworks.

## Examples
There is a selection of `HTML` elements as example in the `docs` folder which is also available as a [GitHub Page](https://absolutholz.github.io/semantic-reboot/). The examples on this page are all without custom styling via classes and can therefore be used for testing purposes.
